# Animal-shelter-data-Exploratory-Analysis
EDA on custom animal shelter data 
My foray into data analytics used dataset given to me by proffesor Georgiana Ifrim of UCD. Its only an EDA and no modeling is done.
The EDA however I made it as comprehensive as possible.
Github is unable to render the ipynb file so I have put link to in in nBViewer
[press here to go :) ](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sachsom95/Animal-shelter-data-Exploratory-Analysis/blob/master/Animal_shelter_data_analysis.ipynb)
Also some of the plots were not rendered to make ipynb notebook smaller size when uploading to github
